subTitle: Kyoto, Japan
desc: Attended this conference with my father. It was not exactly what we had expected, however a fun learning experience overall!
comp:
  - Cultural respect
  - Travelling around in a country with very little accommodation for English speakers
learned:
  - You don’t have to attend a conference if it’s not what you expected!
  - It’s not anyone’s job to be accommodating to English speakers
  - Being respectful and adapting to another country’s way of doing things is important when travelling
  - A love hotel is not somewhere you want to stay with your parents!!!!!
