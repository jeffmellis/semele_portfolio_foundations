title: Undergraduate Degree in Biology (September 2012 – April 2014)
subTitle: University of Victoria
desc: I began my university career thinking that I wanted to get my undergraduate degree in biology and eventually apply to medical school. Did not do well in my courses and did not enjoy learning the subject areas that I was required to study.
comp:
  - Realizing that things do not always go as planned
  - Trusting my own intuition
  - Powering through courses that I hated
learned:
  - Biology is not for me – I wanted to learn about humans not plants or animals
  - You don’t have to stick through something if it isn’t bringing you joy
