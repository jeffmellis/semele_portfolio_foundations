desc: Answering phones, booking and confirming reservations, and planning the dining room before each dinner shift. Greeting customers, taking their jackets, and seating them as quickly as possible. Taking drink orders and serving drinks in the lounge when there was a longer wait. Taking to-go orders and delivering them fresh to the customers. Helping to clean and set tables when the restaurant was very busy. Cashed out the hostess stand at the end of each night.
